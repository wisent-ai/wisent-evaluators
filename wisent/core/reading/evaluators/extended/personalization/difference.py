    Evaluate how different two responses are using Jaccard distance on a scale of 1-100.

    Uses token-level Jaccard distance to measure lexical difference between responses.
    This is fast, objective, and produces varied scores.

    Args:
        baseline_response: The baseline response (string or list of strings)
        steered_response: The steered response (string or list of strings)
        model: The model (not used, kept for API compatibility)
        tokenizer: The tokenizer (not used, kept for API compatibility)
        device: Device (not used, kept for API compatibility)

    Returns:
        Difference score between 1 and 100
        - 1 = Nearly identical (high Jaccard similarity)
        - 100 = Completely different (low Jaccard similarity)
